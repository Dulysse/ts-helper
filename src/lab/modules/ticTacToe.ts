 *
 * - Rules: {@link TicTacToeDefaultRules}
 *
 * - The TicTacToe type is a type-level implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game.
 * - It checks the current state of the game based on the provided board.
 * - It determines if the board is valid, checks for a win or draw condition, and provides the next player's turn.
 * - The board is represented as a one-dimensional array of cells, where each cell can be "X", "O", or empty.
 *
 * @template TBoard - The board type, which is an array of cells (X, O, or empty).
 * @template TRules - The game rules, which define the number of rows and columns, target score, players, and empty cell.
 * - The default rules are defined in `TicTacToeDefaultRules`.
 * - You can override these rules by providing your own rules type.
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import type { Lab } from "@dulysse1/ts-helper";
 *
 * type GAME = Lab.TicTacToe
 * //    ^?  "X, you won! ðŸŽ‰"
 * <[
 *   ["X", "O", "X",]
 *   ["O", "X", "O",]
 *   ["O", "X", "X"]
 * ]>;
 * ```
