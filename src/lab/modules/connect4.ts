 *
 * - Rules: {@link Connect4DefaultRules}
 *
 * - The Connect4 type is a type-level implementation of the Connect 4 game.
 * - It checks the validity of the board, determines the current player, and checks for a win or draw condition.
 * - It returns a string indicating the current player's turn, a win message, or a draw message.
 * - The board is represented as a 2D array of cells, where each cell can be a player ({@link DefaultPlayerOne} or {@link DefaultPlayerTwo}) or an empty cell ({@link EmptyCell}).
 * - The type uses various utility types to ensure the board is correctly formatted and to determine the game state.
 * - The game is played on a board with {@link C4_DEFAULT_MAX_ROW} rows and {@link C4_DEFAULT_MAX_COL} columns, and players take turns dropping their pieces into the columns.
 * - The type is designed to be used in a TypeScript environment, providing type safety and validation for the Connect 4 game.
 *
 * @template TBoard - The board of the Connect 4 game, represented as a 2D array of cells.
 * @template TRules - The game rules, which define the number of rows and columns, target score, players, and empty cell.
 * - The default rules are defined in `Connect4DefaultRules`.
 * - You can override these rules by providing your own rules type.
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * import type { Lab } from "@dulysse1/ts-helper";
 *
 * type GAME = Lab.Connect4
 * //    ^?  " 'Player O', it's your turn. üïπÔ∏è "
 * <[
 *		[".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
 *		[".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
 *		[".", ".", ".", ".", ".", ".", "."],
 *		[".", ".", ".", "X", ".", ".", "."],
 *		[".", ".", ".", "O", ".", ".", "."],
 *		[".", ".", ".", "X", ".", ".", "."],
 *]>;
 * ```
